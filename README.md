<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers"><strong>The Wright Brothers</strong></a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Wright brothers</strong>&mdash;<strong>Orville</strong>&nbsp;(August 19, 1871<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>&ndash; January 30, 1948) and&nbsp;<strong>Wilbur</strong>&nbsp;(April 16, 1867<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>&ndash; May 30, 1912)&mdash;were two American&nbsp;<a title="Aviation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation">aviation</a>&nbsp;pioneers generally credited<sup id="cite_ref-wb-smithson-edu_1-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-wstate-univ_2-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_3-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated&nbsp;<a title="Airplane" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane">airplane</a>. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered,&nbsp;<a title="Aircraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#Heavier-than-air_%E2%80%93_aerodynes">heavier-than-air aircraft</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<em><a title="Wright Flyer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer">Wright Flyer</a></em>&nbsp;on December 17, 1903, 4&nbsp;mi (6&nbsp;km) south of&nbsp;<a title="Kitty Hawk, North Carolina" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Hawk,_North_Carolina">Kitty Hawk, North Carolina</a>. In 1904&ndash;05, the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the&nbsp;<a title="Wright Flyer II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer_II">Wright Flyer II</a>, followed by the first truly practical&nbsp;<a title="Fixed-wing aircraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Wright Flyer III" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer_III">Wright Flyer III</a>. The Wright brothers were also the first to invent&nbsp;<a title="Aircraft flight control system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_flight_control_system">aircraft controls</a>&nbsp;that made fixed-wing&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Powered flight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_flight">powered flight</a>&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Flight dynamics (aircraft)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(aircraft)">three-axis control system</a>, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.<sup id="cite_ref-wb-smithson-inventing_4-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-wagg_tail-org_5-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-aviation-nps_6-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-aero_journal-2003_7-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving "the flying problem". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Using a small home-built&nbsp;<a title="Wind tunnel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tunnel">wind tunnel</a>, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.<sup id="cite_ref-Flying_Machine_patent_13-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their&nbsp;<a title="Dayton, Ohio" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive&nbsp;<a title="Glider (aircraft)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft)#19th_century">glider tests</a>&nbsp;that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee&nbsp;<a title="Charlie Taylor (mechanic)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Taylor_(mechanic)">Charlie Taylor</a>&nbsp;became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many&nbsp;<a title="Claims to the first powered flight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims_to_the_first_powered_flight">competing claims of early aviators</a>. Edward Roach, historian for the&nbsp;<a title="Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton_Aviation_Heritage_National_Historical_Park">Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park</a>, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.</p>

<p>Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for&nbsp;<a title="Thirteen Colonies" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies">colonial unity</a>, initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="United States Ambassador to France" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_France">United States Ambassador to France</a>, he exemplified the emerging American nation.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the&nbsp;<a title="Age of Enlightenment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>.

An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive&nbsp;<a title="France&ndash;United States relations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93United_States_relations">Franco-American relations</a>.

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Wright brothers</strong>&mdash;<strong>Orville</strong>&nbsp;(August 19, 1871<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>&ndash; January 30, 1948) and&nbsp;<strong>Wilbur</strong>&nbsp;(April 16, 1867<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>&ndash; May 30, 1912)&mdash;were two American&nbsp;<a title="Aviation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation">aviation</a>&nbsp;pioneers generally credited<sup id="cite_ref-wb-smithson-edu_1-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-wstate-univ_2-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_3-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated&nbsp;<a title="Airplane" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane">airplane</a>. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered,&nbsp;<a title="Aircraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#Heavier-than-air_%E2%80%93_aerodynes">heavier-than-air aircraft</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<em><a title="Wright Flyer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer">Wright Flyer</a></em>&nbsp;on December 17, 1903, 4&nbsp;mi (6&nbsp;km) south of&nbsp;<a title="Kitty Hawk, North Carolina" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Hawk,_North_Carolina">Kitty Hawk, North Carolina</a>. In 1904&ndash;05, the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the&nbsp;<a title="Wright Flyer II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer_II">Wright Flyer II</a>, followed by the first truly practical&nbsp;<a title="Fixed-wing aircraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Wright Flyer III" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer_III">Wright Flyer III</a>.

<p>The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Flight dynamics (aircraft)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(aircraft)">three-axis control system</a>, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.<sup id="cite_ref-wb-smithson-inventing_4-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-wagg_tail-org_5-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-aviation-nps_6-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wb-aero_journal-2003_7-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving "the flying problem". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Using a small home-built&nbsp;<a title="Wind tunnel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tunnel">wind tunnel</a>, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.<sup id="cite_ref-Flying_Machine_patent_13-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their&nbsp;<a title="Dayton, Ohio" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive&nbsp;<a title="Glider (aircraft)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft)#19th_century">glider tests</a>&nbsp;that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee&nbsp;<a title="Charlie Taylor (mechanic)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Taylor_(mechanic)">Charlie Taylor</a>&nbsp;became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many&nbsp;<a title="Claims to the first powered flight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims_to_the_first_powered_flight">competing claims of early aviators</a>. Edward Roach, historian for the&nbsp;<a title="Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton_Aviation_Heritage_National_Historical_Park">Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park</a>, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.</p>

<p>Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for&nbsp;<a title="Thirteen Colonies" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies">colonial unity</a>, initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies.

<p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and&nbsp;<a title="Colorado Springs, Colorado" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado">Colorado Springs</a>. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Wireless communication" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_communication">wireless communication</a>&nbsp;with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished&nbsp;<a title="Wardenclyffe Tower" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower">Wardenclyffe Tower</a>&nbsp;project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<sup id="cite_ref-tsteslatower_9-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the&nbsp;<a title="General Conference on Weights and Measures" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a>&nbsp;named the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="SI unit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit">SI unit</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic flux density" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_density">magnetic flux density</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a title="Tesla (unit)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)">tesla</a>&nbsp;in his honor.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.</p>
